 - Add nist-beacon to randomness for pass generation
 - Jesus can we please sort out Cynth Logins so I dont need to fill in 5 fields?
 - Remove tlipoma username from code... I cant belive its even in there...
 - Fix variable/class naming conventions. I mean its my first JS program, give me a break ok?
